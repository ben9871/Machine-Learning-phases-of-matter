In this repository I reproduced the results of the paper [1] Juan Carrasquilla and Roger G. Melko, Nature	Physics 64,	063810	(2001) "machine learning phases of matter". 
    The starting point was the Ising model and the first task is to produce Monte Carlo simulations for the
total magnetization as a function of temperature for a square lattice. These data
were then used to train a fully forward neural network to perform supervised learning of the
thermalised and uncorrelated raw configurations sampled by the Monte Carlo simulation
